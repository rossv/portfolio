"Coding, Tool Development, Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling",KLH Engineers,,"Flow data is used  for the calibration and validation of hydraulic models. This data requires processing to ensure uniformity and to prepare for use in several modeling applications such as SWMM and SSOAP. I wrote Excel VBA code to convert data between 5-,15-, and 60-minute data using averages and then format into various rain depth, flow, head, and velocity time series and to export csv files.",http://gdurl.com/7dMV,,Flow Data Processing Script,Project Engineer,VBA; Excel,2013

I worked with several other members of the research group to rehabilitate an old flume that was previously in storage. We also worked on building an intermediate sized flume and planned and constructed a small flume including channel design, plumbing, pump selection,electrical coordination, and a sediment collection system.",http://gdurl.com/p5LQ,,Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory,Research Assistant,Flumes; Vectrino; Laser Depth Gauge; Sketchup,2012
"Research, Field Work, Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling",Earth Processes & Environmental Flows Group,,"Stream channel development in forested areas is profoundly influenced by large organic debris with enters the stream after erosion during high flow events. While it is well documented that increased density of roots in stream banks can increase the strength of the bank, the hydraulic process that arise from rootwads along stream banks is less well understood. This project sought to better understand the effect on shear stress that complicated flow cross sections present. To study this, LIDAR scanning of streambanks and modeling of flows around rootwads was conducted.",http://gdurl.com/q1ds,,Tree Roots and Shear Stress Investigation,Graduate Student,LIDAR; TecPlot; Geomagic; Meshlab,2012
"Research, Construction, Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling",Independent,,"The Tipon channels in Peru demonstrate an understanding of hydraulic principles by the Inca civilization. Irrigation channels were built to convey water down steep gradients without allowing flows to transition from supercritical to subcritical flow. When that transition occurs, hydraulic jumps can be found. Understanding and managing this transition can reduce hydraulic jumps and reduce damage to your channel. As part of a group, I helped to build a computer model of a channel that achieved the same effect and then I planned and built a flume that let us compare the effect of energy dissipation from different surface roughnesses.",http://gdurl.com/EX4g,,Tipon Channel Physical Model,Graduate Student,Flumes; Sketchup,2012
"Research, Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling",Independent,,"Pool-Riffle stream structures can be found in nature and can demonstrate self-maintaining qualities by alternating high and low flows and then reversing flow regimes during high flow events. Modeling of these structures is typically done using one-dimensional models such as HEC-RAS. However, the reversal mechanism may not be found when a two-dimensional model is used. I compared a HEC-RAS and River2D model for several geometries and flow regimes to demonstrate the need to model these structures using more complex models. This paper was recognized at the 2011 World Environmental & Water Resources Congress for coming in 1st place for the student competition.",http://gdurl.com/XghY,,Pool-Riffle Shear Stress Models,Undergraduate Student,HEC-RAS; River 2D; C++,2011

"Research, GIS, Field Work",National Energy Technology Lab,,"NETL was to deploy a new mobile air quality monitoring trailer. Testing of this trailer was proposed to be in the Allegheny National Forest which is dense with oil and gas wells. Utilizing a Leak Detection System, the team planned an efficient route to drive throughout and around the forest to detect methane and hydrocarbons from leaking wells. We identified several areas with significant levels of methane detected and presented our findings to staff.",http://gdurl.com/1KzT,,Allegheny National Forest Gas Survey,Intern,ArcGIS Desktop; ArcPad; Leak Detection System,2009
