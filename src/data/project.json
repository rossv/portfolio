Engineers worked to plan additional sewers system improvements to alleviate the flooding for 100 year storms.

This aided in sizing additional sewers and determining alternative alignments and elevations of parallel sewers.",

Irrigation channels were built to convey water down steep gradients without allowing flows to transition from supercritical to subcritical flow. When that transition occurs, hydraulic jumps can be found. Understanding and managing this transition can reduce hydraulic jumps and reduce damage to your channel. As part of a group, I helped to build a computer model of a channel that achieved the same effect and then I planned and built a flume that let us compare the effect of energy dissipation from different surface roughnesses.",

In addition, an H&H model was needed to evaluate future plans for the two systems. Without high quality data, I coordinated a survey of the existing conveyance systems including field work to verify specific details. Using this data I built a GIS and used it to build an H&H model for each system. I then evaluated each system to determine compliance with the requirements. Led flow monitoring and SWMM modeling for LTCP capacity/alternatives analysis; selected 12 flow monitor locations using mapping and field investigation of regulator structures; managed data collection/quality and calibrated to the minimum effective monitoring span to control costs.",
