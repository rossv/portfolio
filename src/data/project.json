To establish new rates and determine flow values, I completed a Post Construction H&H model using 6 months of flow data from 75 flow meters. The model was modified and calibrated to best model the current flow conditions which were used to establish new rates. Developed and calibrated a post-construction SWMM model used to assess compliance and establish user rates; implemented model updates and calibrated hydrology/hydraulics using ~6 months of data from 75 flow monitors; compiled results and managed post-processing, QA/QC, and flow-monitor data management",

Additionally, the inspections were conducted without a clear agreement of maps to be used to identify structures and pipes. As a result the Authority had a huge amount of disorganized data that was difficult to access and extract actionable information from. To solve this, I obtained various paper and digital maps that were available and processed them into one GIS with clear and logical naming conventions. I then utilized commercial software to create geolocated features for each pipe defect that was recorded by the contractor. I then linked the CCTV photos and video to the actual inspection locations.

        "description": "The City of McKeesport Municipal Authority acquired the treatment systems for Duquesne and Dravosburg. In order to complete a Long Term Control Plan for each system and an Act 537 report, KLH had to show that the system was capable of conveying all flows to treatment including 350% of peak dry flow. In addition, an H&H model was needed to evaluate future plans for the two systems. Without high quality data, I coordinated a survey of the existing conveyance systems including field work to verify specific details. Using this data I built a GIS and used it to build an H&H model for each system. I then evaluated each system to determine compliance with the requirements. Led flow monitoring and SWMM modeling for LTCP capacity/alternatives analysis; selected 12 flow monitor locations using mapping and field investigation of regulator structures; managed data collection/quality and calibrated to the minimum effective monitoring span to control costs.",
