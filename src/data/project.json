As part of a group, I helped build a computer model of a channel that achieved the same effect and then planned and built a flume to compare energy dissipation from different surface roughnesses.",

        "description": "Pool-Riffle stream structures can be found in nature and can demonstrate self-maintaining qualities by alternating high and low flows and then reversing flow regimes during high flow events. Modeling of these structures is typically done using one-dimensional models such as HEC-RAS. However, the reversal mechanism may not be found when a two-dimensional model is used. I compared a HEC-RAS and River2D model for several geometries and flow regimes to demonstrate the need to model these structures using more complex models. This paper was recognized at the 2011 World Environmental & Water Resources Congress for coming in 1st place for the student competition.",

There was concern that increasing capacity of upstream segments would lead to flooding issues along main arteries further down the conveyance system.

The deliverable was a hard drive containing hundreds of gigabytes of photos and video for each pipe in the system. Additionally, the inspections were conducted without a clear agreement of maps to be used to identify structures and pipes. As a result the Authority had a huge amount of disorganized data that was difficult to access and extract actionable information from. To solve this, I obtained various paper and digital maps that were available and processed them into one GIS with clear and logical naming conventions. I then utilized commercial software to create geolocated features for each pipe defect that was recorded by the contractor. I then linked the CCTV photos and video to the actual inspection locations. The deliverable product was a free-to-use GIS map that the Authority could use to identify exactly where problems were located in their collection system and then view the inspection video without using additional software.",

Collaborating closely with operators and other staff, data gaps were identified and resolved, and model controls were developed. Subsequently, the model was employed for preliminary planning of new distribution mains and booster stations, as well as for evaluating valve settings and tank performance.",
