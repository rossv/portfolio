In order to complete a Long Term Control Plan for each system and an Act 537 report, KLH had to show that the system was capable of conveying all flows to treatment including 350% of peak dry flow. In addition, a H&H model was needed to evaluate future plans for the two systems. Without high quality data, I coordinated a survey of the existing conveyance systems including field work to verify specific details. Using this data I build a GIS and used it to build an H&H model for each system. I then evaluated each system to determine compliance with the requirements.",

        "description": "Pool-Riffle stream structures can be found in nature and can demonstrate self-maintaining qualities by alternating high and low flows and then reversing flow regimes during high flow events. Modeling of these structures is typically done using one-dimensional models such as HEC-RAS. However, the reversal mechanism may not be found when a two-dimensional model is used. I compared a HEC-RAS and River2D model for several geometries and flow regimes to demonstrate the need to model these structures using more complex models. This paper was recognized at the 2011 World Environmental & Water Resources Congress for coming in 1st place for the student competition.",

Testing of this trailer was proposed to be in the Allegheny National Forest which is dense with oil and gas wells. Utilizing a Leak Detection System, the team planned an efficient route to drive throughout and around the forest to detect methane and hydrocarbons from leaking wells. We identified several areas with significant levels of methane detected and presented our findings to staff.",
