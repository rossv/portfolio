Using previous flow monitoring data, I constructed an InfoSWMM model and calibrated it to be able to predict flows for large storms and future growth. This included modeling multiple pump stations and a large basin. I was able to recommend locations for additional flow monitoring to increase the usefulness of the model.",Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling
Act 537 Maps using Python,KLH Engineers,"KLH Engineers, Inc.","Robinson Township, PA",,Project Engineer,Developer,ArcGIS Desktop; Python; ArcGIS; GIS,2013,"As a requirement of PA Act 537, several exhibits needed to be created regularly for submission to the PA DEP. These exhibits included data such as soil information and floodplain locations. In order to reduce the tediousness of assembling these exhibits, I programmed a Python script to run inside of ArcGIS to automate the process. To accomplish this, I created statewide datasets of relevant data. The process was reduced from a weeks worth of work for one submission to just a few minutes. The user needed to simply draw an area of interest and fill in some information and in one click, the required PDFs were generated.","GIS, Tool Development"

Clairton GIS - CCTV Integration,KLH Engineers,Clairton Municipal Authority,"Clairton, PA",,Project Engineer,,ArcGIS Desktop; Wincan; GIS,2013,"The Clairton Municipal Authority contracted with a pipe televising company to produce a city-wide database of pipe inspections of their combined sewer system. The deliverable was a hard drive containing hundreds of gigabytes of photos and video for each pipe in the system. Additionally, the inspections were conducted without a clear agreement of maps to be used to identifying structures and pipes. As a result the Authority had a huge amount of disorganized data that was difficult to access and extract actionable information from. To solve this, I obtained various paper and digital maps that were available and processed them into one GIS with clear and logical naming conventions. I then utilized commercial software to create geolocated features for each pipe defect that was recorded by the contractor. I then linked the CCTV photos and video the the actual inspection locations. The deliverable product was a free to use GIS map that the Authority could use to identify exactly where problems were located in their collection system and then view the inspection video without using additional software.",GIS
Creswell Web GIS Proposal,KLH Engineers,Creswell Heights Joint Authority,"Crescent Tonwhsip, PA",,Project Engineer,Developer,ArcGIS Desktop; ArcGIS Online; GIS; Water Distribution; GPS,2013,"The Authority was interested in better managing their water distribution infrastructure. They currently had to pull paper cards for each meter and valve to be serviced. I took an old water model and some CAD drawings and created a GIS using georeferencing. I then created an interactive online version that would allow anyone to pull up information on any valve, hydrant or meter based on location. We proposed further refining the GIS using GPS and data entry from their paper system.",GIS

Tipon Channel Physical Model,Independent,University of Pittsburgh,"Oakland, PA",,Graduate Student,Developer,Flumes; Sketchup; Hydraulics,2012,"The Tipon channels in Peru demonstrate an understanding of hydraulic principles by the Inca civilization. Irrigation channels were built to convey water down steep gradients without allowing flows to transition from supercritical to subcritical flow. When that transition occurs, hydraulic jumps can be found. Understanding and managing this transition can reduce hydraulic jumps and reduce damage to your channel. As part of a group, I helped to build a computer model of a channel that achieved the same effect and then I planned and built a flume that let us compare the effect of energy dissipation from different surface roughnesses.","Research, Construction, Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling"
Tree Roots and Shear Stress Investigation,Earth Processes & Environmental Flows Group,University of Pittsburgh,"Oakland, PA",,Graduate Student,Contributor,Geomagic; LIDAR; Meshlab; TecPlot; Hydraulics,2012,"Stream channel development in forested areas is profoundly influenced by large organic debris with enters the stream after erosion during high flow events. While it is well documented that increased density of roots in stream banks can increase the strength of the bank, the hydraulic process that arise from rootwads along stream banks is less well understood. This project sought to better understand the effect on shear stress that complicated flow cross sections present. To study this, LIDAR scanning of streambanks and modeling of flows around rootwads was conducted.","Research, Field Work, Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling"

Pool-Riffle Shear Stress Models,Independent,University of Pittsburgh,"Oakland, PA",,Undergraduate Student,Contributor,C++; HEC-RAS; River 2D,2011,"Pool-Riffle stream structures can be found in nature and can demonstrate self-maintaining qualities by alternating high and low flows and then reversing flow regimes during high flow events. Modeling of these structures is typically done using one-dimensional models such as HEC-RAS. However, the reversal mechanism may not be found when a two-dimensional model is used. I compared a HEC-RAS and River2D model for several geometries and flow regimes to demonstrate the need to model these structures using more complex models. This paper was recognized at the 2011 World Environmental & Water Resources Congress for coming in 1st place for the student competition.","Research, Hydrologic & Hydraulic Modeling"
